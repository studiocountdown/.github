### About this org
This GitHub organization is where we keep the source code for our websites, internal tools, and more.

### Our tech values
We believe that software should aid the creative process, not replace it. We prohibit the usage of generative AI tools anywhere within the artistic process and we do not implement AI-generated code (although we can't guarantee that upstream open-source projects that we rely on are following the same guidelines).
